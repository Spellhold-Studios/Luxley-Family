## Introduction

The Luxley Family introduces two joinable NPCs, Sebastian and Andrei Luxley, to your game. Sebastian is a Chaotic Neutral playwright with a rather idiosyncratic sense of humour who appears to take great delight in showing his cousin Andrei the world outside their family home. Andrei is a polite, Lawful Neutral young monk with a strong sense of self who has led a rather sheltered life until now. Throughout your journey with them, you will discover that their family is not all that meets the eye. You may have to make some tough decisions&mdash;and the path you choose will have repercussions.

Though you do not need to start a new game to have them join your party, it is advisable to have them join early in order that their story arc is completed. Both banter with all the Bioware party NPCs and they comment on many of the quests in the game.

Sebastian and Andrei both have detailed talk tracks with the PC; they also banter with each other extensively throughout the game.

Note that there is adult content in this mod, but all of it is voluntary on the part of the player&mdash;nothing that you feel uncomfortable with is forced on you.

*Please check the complete [Readme](https://spellhold-studios.github.io/readmes/luxley-family/luxleysoa-readme-english.html) to learn more about this mod before installation.*

### Biography

> Andrei smiles when you ask him about himself. Though he is willing to talk about his relatives and is forthright about his beliefs, he is politely evasive on some subjects. He is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, a skill he developed at a young age, and was trained by an older member of his family. Despite his combat expertise, Andrei has only just left the family estate and seems a little naive about certain aspects of everyday life that you, perhaps, take for granted. Nevertheless, he comes across as quietly confident and it is rare to see him stray from a path he has chosen.

### Biography

> It is fair to say that whenever you question Sebastian about himself he is maddeningly elusive. He is a playwright by trade&mdash;or so he says, though he is secretive about his work and claims that a great deal of what he writes would go over your head. He has a keen sense of frivolity and seems to take little in life with any seriousness. Nevertheless, on occasion it appears that there is something else going on with him, and it would be unwise to underestimate his intelligence.
